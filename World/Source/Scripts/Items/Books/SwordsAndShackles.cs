In its basic form you would acquire a fishing pole and head toward the shore to see what you can catch. Fishing poles can be crafted by carpenters or purchased from fisherman. A fishing pole can only be used a set number of times and it will eventually break from over use. Simply hold the fishing pole, use it, and then select a nearby spot in the water to fish in. During this initial practice, you will catch some fish or pull up soggy clothes or rusty armor. It may be morbid, but you might even pull up the remains of a drowning victim or a bag someone may have dropped in the water years ago.<br><br>You cannot practice on the shore forever if you plan to become even more proficient. After you reach the level of apprentice (50) in seafaring, you will have to acquire a ship and sail away from the safety of shore. Here you will catch more types of things, but also risk fishing up sea serpents. If you face such a beast, and claim victory over it, you may find special items. If you happen to catch a glimpse of a sunken ship below the surface of the waves, you may be able to pull up some decorative treasure from the wreckage below.<br><br>You will likely come into some unusually exotic fish out at sea. Although you are free to slice these up and cook them, they are often more valuable due to how rare they are. If you want to earn some gold for these types of fish, simply find a dock that has a fish tub and place the fish within it. You will be awarded an amount of gold that can be increased based on your seafaring skill.<br><br>Magic fish are often caught by expert fisherman, and you can simply eat these raw and have a temporary increase in strength, dexterity, or intelligence. Unusual seaweed may get caught on your line, and they should not simply be tossed away. Look these plants over because they commonly have alchemical properties that could be of great use when far from land. You will need empty bottles, and then you could use the seaweed to attempt and squeeze the fluids from them to create potions. As previously mentioned, you could likely pull up rusty armor and weapons. Although useless to adventurers, these rusty items can be melted down and reused by iron workers and blacksmiths in town. Simply bring the items to their shops and place them into scrap iron barrels to then acquire the gold. The payment for such items are a gold coin per stone weight of the rusty item.<br><br>Those that choose to be known by this profession are either known as 'sailors' or 'pirates', and it depends on your karma which one you are.

There are exceptions to this as there are a small amount of islands that allow you to launch and dock your ship.

You would never be in a position to own such a vessel, but there are those out there that have them and you will see them on the high seas. Like the small boats, you could have the innocent or the villains on these ships. Pirates tend to slay the crew of the innocent sailors and take all of their wealth. Whatever your motivations are, you can choose to attack any galleon you encounter. A galleon captain can have a crew of 9-12 members, and they will all shoot or throw something at nearby enemies. Some throw rocks, daggers, harpoons, or boulders. Others may be more magically inclined and unleash bolts of fire, cold, or energy.

Like smaller boats, to board a galleon you will need a grappling hook. Simply use it and target any crewmember to launch yourself on board their ship. If you need to return to your ship, you can use your ship's plank to do so. Be warned, that the captain also has a grappling hook they tend to use. If you think you can attack the captain from the safety of your deck, you would be mistaken. They will most likely use their grappling hook to grab onto you and pull you toward their ship so they can have an easier time slaying you.<br><br>Unlike smaller boats, galleon captains can be quite strong or sometimes very powerful opponents. They didn't get a galleon and crew without becoming such. If you plan to attack such a vessel, you would be wise to judge the fight as it progresses. The more powerful the captain, however, the better the loot within the ship's hold. Many think of pirates and sailors as merely men or elves. The high seas are filled with other creatures that seek plunder on the waves. You could face a powerful ogre and their crew of hideous creatures. A devil from hell could have a vessel with a demonic crew looking for souls. If you are a pirate, you may run into a militia crew of sailing soldiers, looking for the likes of you to bring to justice. Whatever the crew, they will support their captains with their lives. Any remaining crew members will heal their captains, so you must dispatch of the crew before facing off with the captain.<br><br>If you manage to sink a galleon, you will see their hold peeking out from the surface of the water. Like the smaller boats, you can search through this hold for whatever goods and riches you want. If you are after some good deck planks, make sure to chop the remaining part of the ship. Be sure to look through a pirate's loot carefully, as there may be a bounty on their heads and the wanted parchment may be in the hold. You can read over the parchment to see what the bounty is on that particular pirate. Giving this bounty parchment to a town or city guard will grant you the reward.<br><br>Lastly, not all enemies on the high seas are pirates. Some are cultists that worship the many vile water deities of myth and legend. They seek only to rid the seas of those that trespass in their god's domain.

The settlement area, on top of this rocky formation, is where sailors come to rest and barter for goods and services. This particular part of the port is a public area, where those that visit any port village will be within the same port area to better interact with each other. Ports are a common place where sailors or pirates relieve themselves of their cargo since they can get more gold for such transactions.<br><br>The dock area is where you can leave your ship if you choose to embark again later. Depending on the port you visit, the dock can be very large or quite small. Some have access to other public areas like the bank, tavern, or guilds. Any creature giving your ship chase will often dive below the surface when approaching the docks, that is why many sailors seek these refuges when they are too weak to fight.</BASEFONT></BODY>", (bool)false, (bool)true);
